# Passarama

This project aims to help people find doramas and brazilian fansubs. 

## How it works

1. Crawlers inspect fansubs pages searching doramas.
2. Title, link and fansub are stored in a database.
3. Front-end consumes API with this data to search doramas and fansubs.

As crawler inspecting takes a long time, steps 1 and 2 are made a few times
in a month. So, it may have some doramas in a fansub that is not stored in the
database.

## Technologies and Tools

* [Crawler](crawler/README.md): Python and Scrapy
* [Back-end](back/README.md): Python, Flask and SQLite
* [Front-end](front/README.md): React and React-Bootstrap
